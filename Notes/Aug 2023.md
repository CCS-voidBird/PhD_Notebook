ToDO list:

1. Attention interpretation

   1. Set all other SNP to 0 - as background (g0);
   2. Set all other SNP to 1 - as interaction background (g1)
   3. Set all other SNP to2 - as strong interactive mode (g2)
   4. other SNP is 1, change the selected SNP as 0,1,2 - get final phenotype (p10,p11,p12)
   5. other SNP is 0, repeat step 3 (p00,p01,p02)
   6. other SNP is 2, repeat step 3(p20,p21,p22)
   7. repeat step 4-6 though entire 1000 SNPs

   Overall, each SNP would have 9 values, expected to have 3 zeros, require: 9*N+3 predictions or 3+(3*N/batch) matrix prediction (set diagonal allele as 0,1,2, got three 1000xN matrix )

   the SNP value by alleles is 
   $$
   \beta_i^{j,k} = (p_{i}^{j,k}-g^k)
   $$
   Where

   ```
   i: marker ID
   j: marker alleles (0,1,2)
   k: background condition
   p: final phenotype 
   g: background value
   ```

    

    it can be extended to SNP by SNP interaction
