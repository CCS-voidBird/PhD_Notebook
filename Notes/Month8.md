+ sort and create GRM plot and subplot by regions

+ RF training by regions

Import picard as RF save function 

Using Eric's R script to regenrate the GRM and sub-GRM

Identify reasons of different accuracy in region separated predictions 

	+ family (genomic corrlation) - maybe less family cluster(relationship) in Central subgroup
	+ 

perform region~ RF test (need over 36h)

(3 traits, 4 regions, 4*6 para sets, 10 rounds per set)



CNN feature importance:

method 1:

​	Top-K rank feature importance export:

		1. rank the clones by its certain trait (TCH, CCS, Fibre), get top 300(other) individuals
		1. sort the genotype map by the ranked index
		1. export the convoluted feature maps (multi-channels)
		1. save them separated by trait, channels, conv layer
