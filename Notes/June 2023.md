1. Current work:

   1. HPC environment transferred into Tensorflow 2.9; DONE
   2. MultiLevel Attention development DONE
      1. Main feature 1: added a matrix of attention weights (SNPxSNP int) after softmax(QK^T) to measure weather the dependency is neccessury
      2. Use 1x1 conv1D and Global average pooling instead of flatten and fully connect layer to generate outputs
      3. The prediction section was changed into a double-portal section:
         1.  A linear one-layer MLP section to predict linear component 
         2.  A non-linear MLP section to predict non-linear component 
   3. make 1000 SNP by PIP DONE
   4. Add dominance attention to Multi-Level
   5. Slides for zoom meeting
   6.
