​	AI >> ML >> DL

​	Electronic brain -> Perceptron -> ADALINE -> XOR -> Multi-layer perceptron -> SVM -> Deep Neural network

Innovations:

​	CPUs, GPUs, TPUs(Tensor Processing Units: designed specifically for deep learning)

Innovations in Algorithm:

​	backpropagation/gradient propagation

​	better activate functions

​	better optimize ways



The State of the art
