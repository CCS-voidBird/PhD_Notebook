>Genomic selection outcomes: daily cattle - 7 year to 18 months in breeding circle;

>Genomic selection in Sugarcane: tonnes of cane harvested (TCH), and commercial cane sugar (CCS), Fibre content (Fibre). Traits that appear to be underpinned by many genes, which have therefore been difficult to improve with other technologies such as marker-assisted selection.

>Data Pre-process
1. A pseudo-diploid model of genotype calling was used where all heterozygous genotypes were considered as one genotypic class, which is similar to the genotype calling procedures used in previous GS studies in sugarcane
