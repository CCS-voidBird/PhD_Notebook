This python file is for building functions that can associate with main model;
    1. add a function that can read/select/transform geno/pheno data from the origin geno/pheno files rather than 
        regenerating subgroups (e.g. 2016_TCHBlup_all.csv)
        
    2. Move/merge plot/model_save functions to this file.
