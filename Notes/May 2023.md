Identification of regulatory variation in dairy cattle with RNA sequence data, Author: A.J. Chamberlain

Analysis pipelines:

1. Sample Collection: Mammary gland tissue samples were collected from 20 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows.
2. RNA Isolation: Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using a commercial RNA isolation kit.
3. RNA Sequencing: The extracted RNA was subjected to RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to generate the transcriptome data.
4. Pre-processing of RNA-Seq data: The raw sequencing data was pre-processed to remove low-quality reads, adapters, and contaminants using quality control software such as FastQC.
5. Alignment: The pre-processed reads were aligned to the bovine reference genome (UMD3.1.1) using a splice-aware aligner such as STAR.
6. Gene Expression Quantification: The aligned reads were counted and gene expression levels were quantified using software such as HTSeq or FeatureCounts.
7. Quality Control: The quality of the RNA-Seq data was assessed by performing a series of quality control checks such as PCA plots, correlation analysis, and hierarchical clustering.
8. Differential Expression Analysis: The gene expression data was analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using statistical analysis tools such as edgeR or DESeq2.
9. Functional Annotation: The identified DEGs were subjected to functional annotation analysis to identify enriched gene ontology (GO) terms, biological pathways, and molecular functions.
10. Validation: The results of the RNA sequencing analysis were validated by performing qRT-PCR on a subset of the genes.
