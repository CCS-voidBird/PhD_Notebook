Task of GS_composer

1. formatting annotation file 
2. Add option of mean and gblup annotation
3. add a beta version of RNN and Bayes NN



```R
###make GBLUP componment as annotation values
fam = read.table("",sep="\t",h=F)[,1:2]
get_auc <- function(bv_name,trait_col=1,val_idx=1){
  gebvs = read.table(bv_name,sep="",h=F,skip = 1)
  anno_data = gebvs[,2]
  anno = cbind(fam,anno_data)
  write.table(anno,"./",row.names=F,col.names=F,quote=F,sep="\t")
```

The RNN require too much time to run through a long sequence, it could be un-economic for GP.

implement Residual Block and transformer 



##current residual block has bugs so need more work##

Debug finished

ResNetï¼š Currently didn't show outstanding performance - gonna test more structures.

BayesB: Use gctb to perform bayesB
