Attention Block prediction



m (m << M) SNPs convert to SNP block $B_n$ 



$Eff_{B_n}$ = $Allele_n * \sum{Epi_i} + bias + Residual$

$Epi_i = alleles_i * weight_i  $

$bias$ -> Dominance effects, etc.



GOALs: Attention Network; Shap investigate

Add LD block to Blocking strategy - maybe different block sizes. (Ask Eric)

Minus means before training

Bayesian posterior information investigate
