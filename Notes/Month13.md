Time table of PhD

TODO list:

extended GBLUP by R (dominance and epistatic effects)

edit sugarcane draft

1. switch results from raw to BLUEs - two train set (~2015 and ~2016)
2. add ~2016 raw CNN results (after training finished)
3. add ~2016 raw GBLUP results (after finished)
4. update abstract
5. main results change - ade GBLUP > CNN > aGBLUP, RF = adeGBLUP

edit project document

1. update sugarcane abstract

2. make a table for case study

3. edit aims and hypothesis
