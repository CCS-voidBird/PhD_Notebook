polyploid related

(1) polyploid genotyping, including the scoring of marker dosage (allele counts) and generation of haplotypes; 

+ identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - targeted SNP arrays

+ untargeted genotyping, usually directly sequencing from species - exome sequencing [1], target enrichment [2]

+ Comparison:

  + > The disadvantages of targeted approaches have been well explored (particularly regarding ascertainment bias, where the set of targeted SNPs on an array poorly represents the diversity in the samples under investigation due to biased methods of SNP discovery) ([Albrechtsen et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B3); [Moragues et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B103); [Didion et al., 2012](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B41); [Lachance and Tishkoff, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B87)), although there are advantages and disadvantages to both methods ([Mason et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B94)). Apart from costs, differences exist in the ease of data analysis following genotyping, with sequencing data requiring greater curation and bioinformatics skills ([Spindel et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B130); [Bajgain et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B6)) as well as potentially containing more erroneous and missing data ([Spindel et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B130); [Jones et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00513/full#B76)).	

(2) genetic and physical mapping, where we look at the possibilities for linkage mapping as well as the availability of reference sequences; 

+ Linkage mapping can be broken into three steps – linkage analysis, marker clustering and marker ordering.
+ Physical mapping

(3) quantitative trait analysis and genomic selection, including tools that perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in bi-parental populations, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and genomic selection and prediction. 

+ QTL analysis
+ 



Polyploid inheritance and simulation

+ mode of inheritance - 
  + disomic inheritance
  + Polysomic inheritance
  + intermediate inheritance (segmental allopolyploidy [3]) (mixosomy [4])

>  Currently there are no dedicated tools available to ascertain the most likely mode of inheritance in polyploids. 

+ Simulation software
  + PedigreeSim [5]
  + Polylink [6] (no longer available)
  + polySegratio [7]
  + HaploSim [8]
