> Several factors determine genomic prediction accuracies, such as training population size, the heritability of the trait of interest, marker density, the statistical model, and the genotyping platforms used (Heffner et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR35); Heslot et al. [2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR36)). However, one of the key factors of genomic prediction accuracy is the genetic architecture of the trait, particularly how many loci and which gene action (additive/non-additive) control the trait (Daetwyler et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR21); Toro and Varona [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR70)). Most agronomically and economically important traits in sugarcane, such as tonnes cane per hectare (TCH) and sugar content determined as commercial cane sugar (CCS), are highly quantitative and complex and assumed to be controlled by many loci (Casu et al. [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR17); Hoang et al. [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-021-03822-1#ref-CR37)).
